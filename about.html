      <p id = "abouttext">Hi! My name is Emmy Krasts and I am currently a full time student and a part time Bookseller. I am majoring in Computer Science at Community College,
        and I plan to transfer to USC for my second year of college. My dream is to eventually become a Game Director, which means I would manage the production and storyline of major 
        video games. Additionally, I am currently the head of design for the Computer Science club website. In my free time, I love to read, code, grow plants, burn candles, and play 
        video games. I started publishing book reviews in 2022, and I plan on keeping it up as long as possible. My favorite genres are fiction and fantasy, but I will read almost anything. 
        My reading goal for 2023 was 40 books, and as I am writing this, I have read 27.
