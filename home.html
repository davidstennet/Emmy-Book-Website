        of the plot might be "This novel takes the term 'maneater' to another level". <br><br>My review:<br>First of all, I devoured this book but it was definitely a challenging one to read. 
        I can't say that I've ever read a horror book before, and this honestly was a great first experience. It did not lack in its ability to make me want to throw up, and it didn't 
        disappoint in its gorey imagery either. I liked the feminist themes in this book, even if they were slightly unhinged. For example, she discusses how women are generally thought 
        to only have two reasons for murder, to escape an abusive relationship or for financial gain. The main character says this is bs, and that women have the same amount of reasons for 
        killing as men do. In her circumstance, she does it because she enjoys it. She also tries to justify cannibalism, which I did not appreciate whatsoever. (These were the parts that
         made me want to throw up). She discusses a lot of themes about womanhood and femininity, and I really liked the way that Summers portrayed the main character as an 
         anti-stereotype. Additionally, the writing in this book was insanely descriptive and mesmerizing, from the way that she would describe different culinary dishes that she enjoyed 
         over her years, or the way she shows the reader exactly how she killed her former lovers. However horrifying this book was in certain parts, I do believe it to be somewhat of a 
         masterpiece.<br><br>Tags: Feminist, Horror, Dark, Funny, Challenging</p>

        <p id = "recdesc1" style = "font-size: 20px;">Genre: Fiction<br>Pages: 736<br><br>Although this book may be daunting to pick up due to the page count, the story spans over three 
          generations and has the capability to reel any reader in. After putting the book down for the day, I would think about the events for hours afterward. This is the first book to 
          make me genuinely sad in a long time. Somehow, months after finishing the book, the characters still remain almost perfectly embedded in my brain.<br>Plus, it was featured in Oprah's Book Club! <br><br>My review:<br>Initially, I thought that this book was going to be boring and 
          monotonous due to my perception of the customers who buy this book and the length. However, when browsing through B. Street Books, I read the synopsis and was intrigued so I 
          bought it. Even after only a few pages, I was super interested in the characters and their development. As and their stories progressed, I felt more and more connected to them. I'd 
          think about deaths long after setting the book down, and have the biggest smile on my face after reading of a new child in the family. There were so many twists and turns that I 
          never expected, and it made the story that much more engrossing. The ending was super satisfying to me, and I enjoyed this book a lot more than I thought I would. Good thing too, 
          because it was 700 something pages.<br><br>Tags: Historical, Sad, Emotional, Literary </p>

        <p id = "recdesc0" style = "font-size: 20px;">Genre: Mystery/Thriller<br>Pages: 288<br><br>This book is an amazing introduction to the Mystery/Thriller genre. A basic synopsis might go like this: A woman gains conciousness in her coma, and believes her husband might have 
        something to do with it. Feeney begs the question, is something really a lie if you believe it's the truth? 
        <br><br>My review:<br> I would like to preface this review by saying that I finished this book in one day. 
        To be honest I picked it off of my TBR shelf because the colors of the cover were really appealing to me, but it ended up being a great choice. It was a really intense novel where you 
        can never really tell what is truly happening because the narrator lies, hence the title. I don't usually read a lot of Mystery/Thriller, so I can only really compare this one to 
        The Silent Patient, which is my all time favorite so far. The two had really similar effects on me, in the way that as I was finishing the book I had the “AHA” moment or whatever and 
        was like holyyyyy. Part of me wants to give this book five stars, but the other part of me says to just leave it at four. Now that I'm thinking about it, it was a really amazing book 
        and I really liked it, maybe enough to give it five stars, but I think I'm going to have to deduct half a point (I deducted a whole point here on the site) because despite finishing it, 
        there are still some things that I don't understand and things that I'm not sure why were relevant to the story. Anyways, its super late and I am so tired and barely able to write this 
        review and am rambling at this point peace out.<br><br>Tags: Dark, Mysterious, Tense, Emotional, True or False</p>

        abortion debate. I should preface by saying I am in no way ashamed of my beliefs, which is why I choose to publicly display this review.
        <br><br>My review:<br> I've always taken notice of this book while I've been working at Barnes and noble, but one day when a customer ended up leaving it on a table, I knew I had to read it.
        While reading the introduction, I was slightly intimidated by the conviction in the authors voice, but as I read each chapter thoroughly, I became absorbed in each persons story. It is 
        important to preface this review by saying that I live in an extremely liberal and privileged area, and I have grown up with the belief that abortion should be a human right. Reading this 
        book provided me with the opportunity to make that belief my own, not just simply one that was inherited from where I live. I plan on annotating this book and encouraging the people around 
        me to read it.<br>I gave this book five stars not only because of the way it helped cultivate my perspective, but for the significance that it has in our world today. Should you decide 
        to read this book, you will learn a lot about abortions, the people that have them, the circumstances that surround them, and the importance they play in each life. I should add, every 
        source that the author uses is cited in the back of the book.<br><br>Tags: Informative, Emotional, Reflective, Feminist </p>
